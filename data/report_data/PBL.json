            "As one of the leading vocational and professional education and training (VPET) provider in Hong Kong, the Vocational Training Council (VTC) will conduct regular manpower surveys and publish reports for 24 major industry sectors to assess their manpower demands and supplies. It is a quantitative survey conducted once every 4 years to collect information of employees count, income, education, and so on. In this 4-year cycle two manpower updates will be conducted through focus group meeting with industry representatives and data analytics of major recruitment platforms like CPJobs and CTgoodjob. The information obtained from the manpower survey aims to facilitating the Government and different stakeholders of industries for formulation of manpower and training plan.  there are 4 million unstructured job advertisements with monthly growth of 100k to 150k need to retrieve, clean and classify. but Data Science Technology could improve the efficiency and accuracy of job advertisements classification.",

            "Decision Tree is a graphical diagram for classification. Each branch of the decision tree presents a potential outcome where the furthest branches on the tree concludes the final answer.  Random forest is a commonly-used machine learning algorithm, which combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. Its ease of use and flexibility have fueled its adoption, as it handles both classification and regression problems.  Our tree objective is judging the job advertisements into a PJT in an industry. Decision tree provides the target users an easy way to visualize the possible results as analysis of the training plans. But Decision Tree focuses on optimizing for the node split at hand, rather than taking into account how that split impacts the entire tree. though Decision Trees is simple and flexible, but makes it prone overfitting  To address overfitting, and reduce the variance in Decision Trees, we are using random forests to training multiple trees.   Random Forests work well with both categorical and numerical data. No scaling or transformation of variables is usually necessary. Also, it is not influenced by outliers to a fair degree. It does this by binning the variables. However, Random Forests can be computationally intensive for large datasets.",
